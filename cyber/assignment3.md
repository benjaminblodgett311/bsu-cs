### Exercise 0. Network Traffic Capturing with Wireshark

- Wireshark 2 had no filter and as a result it received far more packets.

- Capture filters determine what packets are stored by Wireshark. Display filters merely temporarily filter out some of the previously captured packets.

- Capture filters may help performance or help to avoid capturing packets we are absolutely sure are unnecessary. Capturing with a capture filter may prevent us from missing the capture of vital packets which we wanted to view after all.
