## AUG 29

A **Simple Event** is an event that has no more than 1 outcome.

$$
\text{S} = \{ \text{NNN, DNN , NDN, NND, DDN, DND, NDD, DDD} \}
$$
$$
\text{S} = \{ \text{H, TH, TTH, TTT,} \dots \}
$$

Given a sample space $S$, $P(A)$ is called the "probability of $A$" is a number satisfying:

1. $P(A) \geq 0$
2. $P(S) = 1$
3. If $A_1, A_2, \dots$ I don't know what she wrote.

## SEP 5

The **conditional probability** of $A$ given $B$ is denoted

$$
P ( A | B )
$$

eg. The probability of $A$ knowing the $B$ happened

The **general multiplication rule**:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) \cdot P(B)
$$

**Baye's Rule**

$$
P ( A_i | B ) = \frac{P(A_i \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
